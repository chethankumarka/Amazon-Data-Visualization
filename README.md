# Amazon_Reviews_Visualization
Brand-centric visualization of six categories of Amazon Product Reviews dataset. 

A top-down analysis of top
brands and products using reviews can help sellers understand what makes a
product popular and why users like it. Product reviews also give
valuable information about the aspects of a brand or project that
users like or dislike. Sellers can greatly benefit from a visualization
that highlights important characteristics of their brands and
products based on user reviews. In this project, we implemented
a brand-centric visual dashboard for sellers using text analysis
techniques like sentiment analysis and topic modelling using LDA.
